We can fetch files from the remote repo using the command git fetch as: 
    git fetch <host>
    git fetch <host><branch>

And the fetched repo can be read as : host/branch OR FETCH_HEAD

Now I am modifying the file in local master branch.

And this modification was pulled to a nonexist remote repo. 

Ok, this branch was created after my cmd: git push origin master:Remote_Repo_nonexist_3

Now I am modifying this files remotely.
